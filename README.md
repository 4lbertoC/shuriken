Shuriken
========

Shuriken is a small demo I created for my talk about the Chrome DevTools, presented at GDG DevFest Lombardia 2013.

It consists of a set of exercises that explain how the DevTools can be used in the development workflow.

The exercises are represented by a message sent to you by your boss, with some tasks to be completed.

Commands:

- __ALT+F__: Show the next message from the Boss.
- __ALT+R__: Reset the message counter.

Launching
=========

To run the main web application, I just create a server with python, using the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` inside the application folder.

Node.js is needed to launch the demo API server (using `node server.js`).
